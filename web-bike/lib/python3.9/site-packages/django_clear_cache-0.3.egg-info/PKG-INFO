        ![I don't always clear my cache...](https://github.com/rdegges/django-clear-cache/raw/master/clear_cache.jpg)
        
        
        I often find myself in situations where I need to fully clear my website's
        cache (memcached or whatever). Often times this is required because:
        
        - I'm deploying new code and it will fail to run properly with my currently
          cached objects.
        - I need to purge invalid (or old) information.
        - A *million* other reasons.
        
        The standard way to clear your cache is to open up a management shell, eg:
        
        ``` bash
        $ python manage.py shell
        Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 20 2012, 22:39:59) 
        [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        (InteractiveConsole)
        >>> from django.core.cache import cache
        >>> cache.clear()
        ```
        
        But obviously, this is annoying as I have to manually log into my production
        shell.
        
        ``django-clear-cache`` makes this process as easy as running a single
        management command.
        
        
        ## Install
        
        To install ``django-clear-cache``, simply run ``pip install django-clear-cache``
        and you'll get the latest version installed automatically.
        
        Next, modify your Django ``settings.py`` file, and add ``clear_cache`` to your
        ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting:
        
        ``` python
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            # ...
            'clear_cache',
        )
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To clear your cache, simply run the ``clear_cache`` management command:
        
        ``` bash
        $ python manage.py clear_cache
        Your cache has been cleared!
        ```
        
        **NOTE**: This will only (obviously) work if you've got a cache configured (eg:
        memcached, local memory, etc.). If you have no idea what I'm talking about,
        read through the [official Django caching docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/?from=olddocs).
